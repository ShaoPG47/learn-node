- In eventloop/timer.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.
The order will be:
foo
baz
foo
baz
2 : bar
1 : bar
First, foo(2) operates, which will print foo, then push the bar(a//which is 2)
to the event list, it will be executed in next loop, then it will run baz(),
which will print baz, then the foo(1) will be executed, after the same process,
foo and baz will print again, then the event list will push bar(2) and bar(1), which
will print out 2: bar and 1 : bar.
