- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.
The order:
foo
done
Read Error
First, sameAsyncOperation() will be executed, while its loading, the other events
will keep going, after it finished loading, it will be pushed to the event list,
and prints out the data or read error. foo() will be executed right after the
sameAsyncOperation() is executed, but it will not wait for it to be finished, so
console wil print out foo first.
Then, console will print out done, so the only thing left in event list is
sameAsyncOperation(), it will return the output depends on the data, if reading was
successful, then print "Data" + data, but in my case, it was unsuccessful, so it prints
Read Error.
This is because readFile is unblocking, node.js will not wait for something to finish
then execute next line of code.
