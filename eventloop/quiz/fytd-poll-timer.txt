- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.
someAsyncOperation
101ms have passed since I was scheduled
setTimeout will be executed first, but it will actually be executed after 100ms,
in the same time, someAsyncOperation will start reading file, it will first print
someAsyncOperation, the callback function will be doing nothing for 10ms

This will not change the order,

- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?
This will not change the order,
