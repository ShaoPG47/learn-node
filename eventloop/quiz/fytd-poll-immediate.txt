- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/immediate.js.
Error
I was scheduled to run immediately
7ms have passed since I was scheduled
I assume that because the setTimeout, setImmediate and prints data or err all inside
readFile loop, and there is a 10ms delay, so they will execute after the file is loaded, then it will print data or
err, after that, setTimeout and setImmediate will be executed, setTimeout will be
executed after 5ms, and setImmediate will execute immediately.


- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?
No, although the delay was 5ms, but the actual delay is more than 5ms, which is 6-7ms in
my case, so when I set the timeout to 0, then delay is also 1-2ms, it will not change
the order.
